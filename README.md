## Description

### Purpose

According to estimates, one out of every three pets will go missing at some point in their lives. Millions of pets are missing every year, and many of them may never return home.

The purpose of PawsReunite is to help pet owners find their lost pets and to help people who have found lost pets find their owners. This is a valuable service because lost pets can be very difficult to find, and even if they are found, it can be difficult to track down their owners. This web application can help to bridge this gap by providing a central platform where pet owners and people who have found lost pets can connect.

### Functionality/Feature

#### User Registration and Authentication: 
   
To create a lost/found pet post, users must create new accounts first, so they can be contacted when there is any update. 

Comparing to general users, admin users will have the authorisation to remove inappropriate or irrelevant content, such as spam or offensive posts. Admin users can also remove certain users and all related posts.

#### Report lost pet

Pet owners can report their lost pets, providing details such as pet characteristics (including colour, breed and other descriptions), photos, last seen location and contact information.

#### Report found pet

Users who find a lost pet can report it, providing details such as pet description, photos, found location and contact information.

#### Pet Search

Users can search for lost pets based on location, colour, breed, or other characteristics. Based on the provided information, the application will display a list of lost pets that match the search criteria.

#### Communication

To facilitate better communication between the users, users can leave comments under the lost/found pet posts so they can provide helpful information if available.

#### Pet Care Resources

Users are able to find information about pet care on the platform. This information includes articles, tips, and links to other websites.

#### Potential Match and Notification (Nice to have): 

The application runs a matching algorithm to connect lost pets with found pet based on similar characteristics, such as breed, colour, or lost/found location. Users will receive in-app and email notifications when a potential match is found.

### Target Audience

The target audience for PawsReunite is pet owners, people who have found lost pets, and animal shelters or rescue organizations. Pet owners are the primary users of this application, as they are the ones who are most likely to be looking for lost pets. People who have found lost pets are also potential users, as they may be looking for a way to reunite the pet with its owner. Animal shelters and rescue organizations can also use this app to help find homes for lost pets.
